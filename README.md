- edit `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

- in nginx.conf change location root to point at clients directory, eg:

        location / {
                root   /Users/robertwilliams/Sites/vapor/client;
                index  index.html index.htm;
                mp4;
                gzip off;
                gzip_static off;
        }

- In `server/api/files.js`, uncomment line 35 `staticServer = 'http://' + ip + ':8080/';`

- `sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.nginx.plist`
